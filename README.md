Right now, a lot of stuff works! Which is a good thing. Here's a list of the stuff that currently "works":
* Colorized output
* Lua configuration
* Lua vocab
* Rooms, fixtures, etc
* Setting states of fixtures via Lua
* A lot of built-in sass

However, there are a few things that need to be added. If they're marked with + then Ya Boy is working on it:
* +Player inventory
* Probably some code that isn't used anymore, that we don't need. Things like ReactorList
* Integration of Rant for some sentences at some point (future)
* +Demo game

If you have an improvement, please send a pull request, I'll look at it as soon as possible.
